# About me
## My Interests
My hobbies include:
* **Playing Videogames**
> I like to play many different videogames like _Cyberpunk 2077_, _Elden Ring_, and _Skyrim_.  
* **Music**
> I like to listen to many different albums because it brings me to a sence of peace and I can simply _mellow out_. I mostly listen to classic/alt/grunge rock bands like _Pink Floyd_, _Radiohead_, _Sound Garden_, etc. 
* **Working Out**
> When I workout, I try to work out at least 4 times a week and that includes push, pull, and leg days.
## Websites I Recommend
[Youtube](www.youtube.com) - I enjoy browsing youtube since it provides lots of entertaining videos and helpful tutorials wether it be for school or a DIY project.
[Amazon](www.amazon.com) - I find Amazon to be my favorite website for online shopping because If you can think of any item or component, its probably on Amazon. Not to mention all of the deals they have from time to time.
